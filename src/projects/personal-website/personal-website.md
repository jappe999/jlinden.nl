A personal website is something, I think, adds great value to someones digital life. It can be a digital garden of some sorts. I've always wanted my personal website to be like that anyway. I've had quite a few sites in the past years but none of them felt like that digital garden, until now.

This page lists the sites I've built in the past years and what I used them for.

## Webdrawings.nl

Halfway through high school (2018), I started working as a freelance web developer. I was a novice at the time but still created a pretty cool website if I say so myself. It was around the time that PWAs got more attention and I wanted to integrate some of the capabilities of a PWA in to my website.

I built the site in Nuxt because I was using Vue but wanted a more structured development experience. I also used one of the first versions of Tailwind, which I still use today.

The website source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jappe999/webdrawings).

## jappe999.github.io

Aside from my business website, I wanted to have a personal website as well. And GitHub came up with GitHub pages. The site was [based on a Codepen](https://codepen.io/jappe/pen/jqEVNJ) I created, and contained a simple timeline with several milestones up to that point.

## jlinden.nl V1

The timeline website was fun and all, but it was time for something new. And a new framework to try out. This time it was Svelte.

This was one of the first times I actually started with creating a design in Figma. After I more or less finished my design and knew what I wanted to build, I started out trying building the site. After a month or so of tinkering on the site, I put it online. It wasn't the smartest idea because it was broken in several places. Eventually I lost interest in the design and started moving my focus to [Boodschrappen](Boodschrappen.md).

## jlinden.nl V2

Version one of jlinden.nl had an overcomplicated design and was all over the place. So, I decided to build something simpler. I based the design off of [this mockup](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/nft-marketplace-landing-page-design-cb53f1bb-f18f-4041-a8b7-b2e0992c14b9) and tweaked and simplified it where I saw fit.

I also wanted to build something with speed. And what better way to do that than with a static site. I used 11ty to start simple and only complicate things if necessary.

Overall, I'm really happy with how it looks and easy it is to maintain. I think I will stick with this site for a while. :)

## What's next?

I will keep maintaining the latest version of jlinden.nl for now and might replace or add a few components here and there.
