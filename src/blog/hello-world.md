title: Hello world!
abstract: My first post on this blog.

Every blog needs a start, right? Well, this is the start of my blog. I've been putting it off for a while now, but I really do want to start it. I'll try to figure out what works for me.

Maybe I'll write about me struggling to solve a problem in one of my apps. Or about a fun new piece of technology I discovered. The most important thing I want to achieve with this blog is to gain confidence with writing. So, if you read this, that already means I have gained the confidence to share this post with you! ðŸŽ‰

I'll keep it short because I really need to finish all the other parts of this website. Hopefully the next post(s) will be a bit longer.

_See you in the next one!_
