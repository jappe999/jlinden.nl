_Hi there! ðŸ‘‹_

My name is Jasper. I create software in my free time. What kind of software? Glad you asked!

I build whatever interests me. That means my projects range from websites and apps to a [rendering engine](/projects/rendering-engine) and a [private cloud infrastructure](/projects/private-cloud).

Wow. It's really hard to write down what interests me! Anyhow, at the moment I'm working on my app [Boodschrappen](/projects/boodschrappen). It aims to simplify grocery shopping in the Netherlands by allowing users to compare products from different supermarkets.

I'm also trying to keep a blog. Something that I've been wanting to have for a while now, but never saw it through. You can find [my first blog](/blog/hello-world) on this website.

If you want to keep in touch with me, you can find me on socials.
