# jlinden.nl

Hi there! This is the source for my [personal website](https://jlinden.nl).

## Quick setup

This site is built with 11ty, a simple static site generator.

First, install the depencies.

```sh
npm i
```

Then, run the site with the command below. This will start an 11ty watcher as well as a TailwindCSS watcher.

```
npm run start
```

## Build for production

Run the command below to generate the static site. It will generate an optimized stylesheet and convert the Markdown files to HTML.

```sh
npm run build
```
